## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the implementation for **Laboratory 2** in the *IL2235 Real-Time Systems* course at KTH.  
The focus of this lab is to **implement and analyze real-time task scheduling** and to study how different priority assignments and timing constraints affect system performance.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

- Implement periodic and aperiodic real-time tasks.  
- Use **POSIX real-time extensions** for task creation, scheduling, and timing.  
- Measure **execution time**, **jitter**, and **deadline misses**.  
- Compare scheduling policies such as **FIFO**, **Round Robin**, and **Deadline Monotonic**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Environment

- **Language:** C  
- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu recommended)  
- **APIs:** POSIX Threads (pthreads), Timers, and Real-time scheduling policies  
- **Build system:** CMake / Makefile  
- **Hardware:** ES-Lab-Kit (if applicable)
